The Area which was covered by water few years back is now a barren land
due to drastic changes happening in the ecosystem that is global warming
followed by the rise in temperatures and in some polar regions the 
areas are overflodded with more water.Inorder to alert the people and
environmentalists this project aims to estimate the change in area 
covered by water bodies in an Area by comparing the satellite images of
an area in  different years.Auto encoder is used which is an artificial
neural network to extract water bodies from high-resolution remote 
sensing images.This model is typically capable of reconstructing data 
similar to the class of observations of which the model observed during
training.The segmented masks which are generated using auto encoder of 
a satellite image of an area over different years are used for estimating
the change in area of water bodies  using Support Vector Machine.
